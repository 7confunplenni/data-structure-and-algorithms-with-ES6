This exercises are based from the book [Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920029557.do) - [by Michael McMillian (O’Reilly)](http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/518) ISBN - 978-1-449-36493-9.

The purpose of this repo is to update the exercises to ES6 standards and to correct the errors from the examples that this book has.

## Examples in this repo

| **Num** | **Type** | **Exercises** | **Description** |
--- | --- | --- | ---
| 1.- | [Array](./02-chapter-Arrays.js) | 4 | The `Array` is the most common data structure in computer programming
| 2.- | [Lists](./03-chapter-List.js) | 5 | A `List` is an ordered sequence of data, where elements are not meant to be ordered.
| 3.- | [Stacks](./04-chapter-Stacks.js) | 3 | A `Stack` is an example of Last-in, First-Out (LIFO)
| 4.- | [Queues](./05-chapter-Queues.js) | 3 | A `Queue` is an example of First-in, First-Out (FIFO)
| 5.- | [Linked List](./06-chapter-1-Linked-List.js) | 4 | A `Linked list` is a collection of objects called nodes. Each node is linked to a successor node in the list using an object reference.
| 6.- | [Double Linked List](./06-chapter-2-Double-Linked-List.js) | 4 | Traversing a `Double linked list` are more efficient, since we no longer have to search for the previous node.
| 7.- | [Circular Linked List](./06-chapter-3-Circular-Linked-List.js) | 4 | The reason you might want to create a `Circular linked list` is if you want the ability to go backward through a list but don’t want the extra overhead of creating a doubly linked list.
| 8.- | [Dictionaries](./07-chapter-Dictionaries.js) | 3 | A `Dictionary` is a data structure that stores data as key-value pairs



### To run the examples we need the following:

- NodeJS Install
- Open Any Terminal and position to the folder where the files are located
- execute the command: `$ node [file-name.js]`
