Type inference is one of the key features of PhpStorm that helps you write cleaner and more reliable code by automatically detecting the types of variables, expressions, and parameters. PhpStorm 2019.2.2 improves this feature by supporting more cases of union types, nullable types, and generic types. For example, PhpStorm can now infer the type of a variable that is assigned a value from an array with mixed types, such as `$a = [1, 'foo', true];`. PhpStorm can also infer the type of a parameter that is declared with a union type hint, such as `function foo(int|string $x) ;`.
 
Parameters info tooltip is another useful feature of PhpStorm that shows you the expected types and names of parameters for a function or method call. PhpStorm 2019.2.2 improves this feature by showing you the default values of optional parameters and highlighting the current parameter that you are typing. For example, if you type `foo(`, PhpStorm will show you a tooltip with `foo(int|string $x = null)`, where `$x` is highlighted.
 
PhpStorm 2019.2.2 also includes many bugfixes and improvements for PHP, such as:
 
- Fixed an issue where PhpStorm would freeze when editing PHP files with large arrays.
- Fixed an issue where PhpStorm would not recognize some PHP 7.4 syntax features, such as arrow functions and numeric literal separators.
- Fixed an issue where PhpStorm would not resolve some namespaces correctly when using PSR-4 autoloading.
- Fixed an issue where PhpStorm would not show code coverage for PHPUnit tests run with Xdebug 3.
- Fixed an issue where PhpStorm would not suggest some built-in PHP functions in code completion.

In addition to PHP, PhpStorm 2019.2.2 also brings many bugfixes and improvements for the Web, such as:

- Fixed an issue where PhpStorm would not recognize some TypeScript syntax features, such as optional chaining and nullish coalescing.
- Fixed an issue where PhpStorm would not show code completion for some CSS properties and values.
- Fixed an issue where PhpStorm would not format HTML code correctly when using Prettier as a code formatter.
- Fixed an issue where PhpStorm would not highlight some syntax errors in JavaScript and TypeScript files.
- Fixed an issue where PhpStorm would not run ESLint autofix on save for JavaScript and TypeScript files.

Finally, PhpStorm 2019.2.2 also includes all the latest improvements made to the IntelliJ Platform, such as:

- Improved performance and stability of the IDE.
