But did you know that there are some hacks and tips that can help you earn more SB faster and easier? In this article, we will share with you some of the most amazing stuff that you can get with Swagbucks and how to get them.
 
## 1. Get a $10 Bonus When You Sign Up
 
One of the easiest ways to get more SB is to sign up for Swagbucks using a referral link from a friend or a website. This way, you will get a $10 bonus (or 1000 SB) when you earn your first 1000 SB within 30 days of signing up. That's like doubling your earnings right away!
 
To find a referral link, you can ask your friends who are already using Swagbucks or search online for websites that offer Swagbucks referrals. You can also share your own referral link with your friends and family and earn 10% of their earnings for life.
 
## 2. Use the SwagButton Extension
 
The SwagButton is a browser extension that helps you earn more SB by notifying you of cashback opportunities, coupons, and deals when you shop online. You can also use it to search the web, watch videos, and take surveys without leaving your browser.
 
The SwagButton also gives you access to exclusive Swag Codes that can be redeemed for extra SB. Swag Codes are short phrases or words that are posted on the Swagbucks website, social media, or newsletter. You can enter them on the SwagButton or the Swagbucks website to get bonus SB.
 
## 3. Complete Your Daily Goal
 
Every day, Swagbucks sets a daily goal for you to earn a certain amount of SB. If you reach your goal, you will get a bonus SB reward. The bonus amount varies depending on your goal and how often you reach it.
 
You can see your daily goal and progress on the homepage of the Swagbucks website or app. You can also activate a streak bonus by reaching your goal for several consecutive days. For example, if you reach your goal for 7 days in a row, you will get an extra 25 SB bonus.
 
## 4. Join the Swago Board
 
Swago is a bingo-like game that lets you earn bonus SB by completing various tasks on a board. Each task corresponds to a square on the board and has a different value of SB. Some tasks include shopping online, taking surveys, watching videos, referring friends, and more.
 
To join the Swago board, you need to visit the Swago page on the Swagbucks website or app and click on "Join". You will then see a board with 25 squares. You can complete as many tasks as you want and submit your board before the deadline to get your bonus SB.
 
## 5. Redeem Your SB for High-Value Gift Cards
 
One of the best things about Swagbucks is that you can redeem your SB for hundreds of gift cards from popular brands like Amazon, Walmart, Starbucks, Target, and more. You can also choose from different categories like entertainment, food, travel, fashion, and more.
 
However, not all gift cards have the same value of SB. Some gift cards require fewer SB per dollar than others. For example, a $25 Amazon gift card costs 2500 SB while a $25 Starbucks gift card costs 2625 SB. That means you can save 125 SB by choosing Amazon over Starbucks.
 
To find the best value for your SB, you can compare the different gift cards available on the Swagbucks website or app and look for the ones that have the lowest SB per dollar ratio. You can also look out for sales and discounts on certain gift cards that can help you save even more SB.
